      <h2>COMOON</h2>
      <p>Comoon is an acronym of modern and tradition. This start up project was created with the objective of preserving craftsmanship’s tradition. The first idea came from 3 founders’ passion to work with craftsmen back to their home countries in Indonesia, Mexico, and Colombia. Therefore from a conscious thought on these disciplines that for years have been threatened by mass produced industrialized consumer habits, but also basing ourselves in an actual trend that looks constantly to the return of local consumption dynamics. Understanding this as a huge cultural problem, we want to sustain their way of living by giving them a constant flow of income and hopefully inherit the technical skill and knowledge owned by the next generation of handcraft skilled workers. We develop an idea where Comoon is the meeting point between customer seeking for customizable products and skill workers who want to preserve tradition.</p>

      <h2>KINANTI EARCUFF</h2>
      <p>Inspired by tuberose flowers, it is a fragrant flower who symbolizes love and soothes around. Kinanti is designed both for aesthetic and personality expressions. The story behind flower bud and bloom reveal a milestone path of a long life journey as well as dangling tassel at the lower part which symbolized a dynamic movement and unstable cheerful life. It is handcrafted with sterling silver material which is dipped in 18 carat yellow gold with swarovski and pink tourmaline precious stones. As named it as <i>Kinanti</i>, which means beautiful song, I hope this earcuff would empower women to spread positivity and courage in her journey of motherhood.</p>

      <h2>DEWI SRI COLLECTION</h2>
      <p>In Tulola Design, Dewi Sri collection was born through the imagery paddy life cycle. This collection was born organically as a symbol of Indonesian fertility and growth. Collaboration among soil, water drops, sunshine, fire, and smoke give a beauty in harmony. Not only visually appealing, dewi sri reminds us to protect our mother nature through a traditional Balinese irrigation system called <i>“Subak”</i> which is getting endangered through the years. Every piece in this collection, especially earrings is designed uniquely through asymmetrical form to appreciate and empower diversity of Indonesian women.</p>

      <h2>OFFERING COLLECTION</h2>
      <p>Collaborating with Jenggala Ceramics, this collection was inspired by Balinese ritual culture and heritage. Offering collection is a tableware set to emerge a healthy eating lifestyle through human senses approach. The emotion and compassion of Balinese lifestyle creates an eternal soul which I transformed into a sophisticated design. I implemented a holy snack <i>palegembal</i> flower motif with the basic shape of vessels from Balinese ceremony. I combine ceramic’s material advantage with Indonesian eating tradition by creating a stackable family set portion to simplify the storage. The Offering collection is ready to accompany your healthy lunch and hearty dinner by giving a bliss and homey feeling to the entire family.</p>

      <h2>BENOA RANGE</h2>
      <p>Collaborating with Kevala Ceramics, this range was inspired by beach elements such as sea salt granules, tides, waves, and rocks. Its subtle combination of rustic surface texture gives an exciting feeling to the range. This range is individually hand carved at Kevala studio. Having variative of shapes and size, Benoa range fits to accompany your tapas dining with some detail touch on plating. This range is selected to reflect the beauty of Water Blow, in Nusa Dua Bali.</p>

      <h2>SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT CREATOR</h2>
      <p>As a visual translator, I create visual imagery based on uncontested processes. Starting from brainstorming, creating mood boards, taking a photoshoot, styling, editing, wording, until measuring key performance indicators. This digital imaging is a new way to create brand awareness, interest, engage loyalty, and sales to early adopter customers specifically on social media and website or mobile application based.</p>
