      <h1>I've always been fascinated 🤩 by the design world since I was a kid.</h1>
      <p>I started by drawing illustrations throughout my childhood, studying visual communication design at the university, then working as a graphic designer ever since I graduated.</p>
      <p>Seeing the world shifting to digital has made my interest expand to digital design and technology. I was given the opportunity to redesign the website of my <a href="https://www.intercruises.com/" target="_blank">previous company</a> and update the internal web app of my <a href="https://www.tui.co.uk/" target="_blank">current company</a>, where I collaborated closely with the developer team and the stakeholders as users.</p>
      <p>This is where I discovered my newfound passion: <strong>digital product design</strong>, which led to my decision to do a UX/UI design bootcamp, where I learned to approach a problem by assessing business viability, technical feasibility, and user desirability. My goal is to translate the business objectives into an optimal product that <strong>solves the user's problem</strong> while meeting the business and technical constraints. It's never a smooth process and involves numerous iterations, but it always brings me joy when everything falls into place.</p>
      <p>My background in graphic design has given me a solid foundation in visual design. I also enjoy coding with HTML/CSS and aspire to have more front-end development skills under my belt. Apart from being well-organized and having excellent attention to detail, I am a firm believer in 'less is more'.</p>
