      <h2>User Interviews üí¨</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="left-column">
      <p>For this project, I chose the topic of <strong>exercise habits</strong>. I started the discovery phase by doing <strong>user interviews</strong> to get an insight into the problems that users faced when doing exercise activities.</p>
      <p>I created an interview guide and set up in-person and phone call interviews with 7 people (5 males and 2 females), students and workers, aged 23-33 years old.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="right-column">
      <p class="large-text no-margin-top"><strong>Interview Guide</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Can you tell me about your exercise activities?</li>
        <li>How frequently do you exercise?</li>
        <li>What are the reasons you do exercise?</li>
        <li>Do you have any challenges to maintain your exercise routine?</li>
        <li>Can you tell me about the last few times you decided not to do exercise?</li>
        <li>What did you do instead?</li>
        <li>Do you keep track of your exercise routine?</li>

    <div class="middle-column">
      <p>By doing an <strong>affinity map</strong> to synthesize the data from the user interviews, I found a <strong>recurring problem</strong> that was mentioned by 5 out of 7 interviewees: when they feel <strong>unmotivated</strong>, they decided <strong>not to do exercise</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Solution üéØ</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="middle-column">
      <p>I thought of ways to encourage users to still do exercise when they feel unmotivated, and I gained insights by looking back at some of the <strong>user quotes</strong> from the interviews:</p>
    </div>
    <div class="middle-column">
      <p class="large-text">1. Make the exercise <strong>fun</strong>, like a <strong>game</strong></p>
      <p>Two interviewees mentioned that they <strong>preferred playing games</strong> instead of doing exercise.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="middle-column">
      <p class="large-text">2. To <strong>reduce friction</strong>, choose an exercise with the least effort ‚Üí <strong>walking</strong></p>
      <p>One interviewee mentioned that his <strong>preferred exercise</strong> is walking because it <strong>doesn't require a big effort</strong>.</p>
      <img src="images/walkabit/user-quotes-2.png" alt="User Quotes"/>
    </div>
    <div class="middle-column">
      <p class="large-text">3. Provide a sense of <strong>satisfaction</strong> and <strong>reward</strong> to <strong>build a habit</strong></p>
      <p>Taken from a best-selling book 'Atomic Habit' by James Clear. It talks about <strong>simple rules</strong> that will help <strong>develop good habits</strong> and stop bad habits.</p>

      <h2>Prototype üöÄ</h2>

    <div class="middle-column">
      <p>It's Saturday and Tom feels a little <strong>lazy</strong> to do his exercise, but he feels guilty if he stays home all day. He finds the Walkabit app and downloads it, hoping it would <strong>motivate</strong> him to stay active today.</p>

      <h2>Ideation üí°</h2>

    <div class="middle-column">
      <p>I started by doing <strong>Crazy 8's</strong> to generate a lot of design ideas.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="artwork">
      <img src="images/walkabit/crazy-8.jpg" alt="Crazy 8"/>
    </div>
    <div class="middle-column">
      <p>I then combined a few ideas into my lo-fi prototype. Inspired by <strong>video games</strong>, I went with the concept of playing a character doing walking missions. There's a story behind every mission and a reward after completing each one, to <strong>engage</strong> users.</p>

      <h2>Design Iterations üîÑ</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="middle-column">
      <div class="alignment">
        <h2 class="number">1</h2>
      </div>
      <p>From the usability testing, some users were <strong>unsure what to do</strong> after selecting a mission, "Is the route shown a suggested one? Can I walk a different route?" To make it clear to the users, I added an <strong>instruction</strong>.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="artwork">

    </div>
    <div class="middle-column">
      <div class="alignment">
        <h2 class="number">2</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Users wanted to know the <strong>progress</strong> of their walk during the route and the <strong>destination</strong> they're going to, so I added this information. Some users also raised <strong>safety concerns</strong> about going to an unknown place so I used <strong>landmarks</strong> as walking destinations.</p>
    </div>

      <div class="alignment">
        <h2 class="number">3</h2>
      </div>
      <p>Users wanted to know how many <strong>calories they burn</strong> in a mission, so I added this information to the mission completion summary.</p>

      <h2>Conclusions üí´</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="middle-column">
      <p>Walkabit helps to <strong>build a habit of staying active</strong> and doing exercise even when the users are unmotivated, by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gamifying walking</strong> (turning a low-effort exercise into something fun to do)</li>
        <li><strong>Providing satisfaction</strong> (completing missions) and <strong>rewards</strong> (collectible items)</li>
        <li><strong>Tracking the progress</strong> of their routine</li>
      </ul>
      <p>When doing usability testing, I received many feedback on the game feature that <strong>didn't actually affect</strong> the user flow. They were suggestions on how they think the game would be more interesting for them. While these are good to improve the retention, in this early phase of app development, it's important to <strong>prioritize the features</strong> that are crucial for the <strong>MVP</strong>.</p>
      <p>There are many different kinds of games, and users have different game preferences. If given the opportunity, I would like to explore a different gaming experience to incorporate into the app.</p>

      <h2>Next Steps üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="middle-column">
      <p>If I were to continue working on the design, my next steps would be to add:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Custom destination</strong><br>
        From usability tests, users want the option to <strong>input their own destination</strong> such as work, school, home, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Round-trip missions</strong><br>
        Users want a <strong>round-trip route</strong> if they start from home, since they have to go back home anyway.</li>
        <li><strong>Notification when the user's been inactive all day</strong><br>
        Implement <strong>notifications</strong> to encourage users to do missions when they haven't or barely moved all day.</li>
        <li><strong>Social feature ‚Üí sharing, add friends, leaderboard</strong><br>
        Users want to <strong>share</strong> their achievements and <strong>compare</strong> their progress among their friends. This also serves as accountability partner.</li>
        </ul>
