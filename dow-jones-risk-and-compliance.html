    <div class="middle-column">
      <p class="large-text no-margin-top"><strong>Background</strong></p>
      <p>RiskCenter Financial Crime is Dow Jones' B2B product under Risk & Compliance, designed for conducting due diligence on potential customers, ongoing monitoring, and sanctions screening. The <strong>users</strong> of this product include <strong>financial institutions</strong> looking to ensure compliance with regulations. One of the tasks they often do is performing a database search for <strong>risk profiles</strong> on entities and individuals, assessing them to make informed decisions.</p>

    <div class="middle-column">
      <p class="large-text no-margin-top"><strong>Problem</strong></p>
      <p>From <strong>user feedback</strong>, we identified several problems. Specific to the risk profile page, users complained that there was a <strong>lot of blank space</strong> in the UI. "The sidebar takes an unreasonable amount of space, leaving too little room for actual profile information," said a user. Users wanted to view more data at first glance without having to scroll too much, stating that information density was important for them to be efficient in their workflow. Users also reported a <strong>lack of clear visual hierarchy</strong> and a <strong>confusing reading pattern</strong> in some sections.</p>
      <p class="large-text pull-quote">Users are struggling to assess risk profile pages efficiently due to low information density and lack of clear visual hierarchy.</p>
      <p>Apart from user feedback, we also found <strong>accessibility issues</strong>, e.g. unmet minimum color contrast, and missing aria-label and role. The UI felt <strong>outdated</strong>, and it wasn't built using a design system, making it difficult to maintain consistency.</p>

    <div class="middle-column">
      <p class="large-text no-margin-top"><strong>Solution</strong></p>
      <p>We analyzed the problems and agreed on how to solve them:</br>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Optimize information density</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Improve information architecture and visual hierarchy</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Comply with accessibility</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Modernize UI</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Build design system</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The goals were to enhance usability, improve user satisfaction, and ultimately, increase sales and retention.</p>

      <h2>Design Process üë®üèª‚Äçüíª</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="middle-column">
      <p>I partnered and worked in parallel with a Product Designer focusing in UX. While they initiated their process with a content audit, site map, user flows, content massing, and then wireframes, I started mine with a design competitive analysis, followed by UI audit, design direction, visual design, prototype, and design system. Each of us had our own responsibilities, but we <strong>collaborated closely</strong> in every step.</p>
      </br>
      <p class="large-text no-margin-top"><strong>Design Competitive Analysis</strong></p>
      <p>I analyzed the top ten competitors, among them were Factset and Refinitiv, where I found both providing a <strong>highly optimized screen real estate</strong> with information density while maintaining a solid information architecture, clear visual hierarchy, and accessibility compliance.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="middle-column">
      <p class="large-text no-margin-top"><strong>UI Audit</strong></p>
      <p>After an extensive audit of the colors, shadows, typography, icons, and grids, plenty of inconsistencies were identified in the UI, predominantly in the colors. We decided to <strong>consolidate redundant colors</strong> for greater consistency, and make adjustments to ensure all elements have sufficient color contrast.</p>

      <p class="large-text no-margin-top"><strong>Design Direction</strong></p>
      <p>The findings from design competitive analysis and UI audit served to inspire and guide the design direction. The chosen concept of our moodboard was Expert Experience, an experience that conveys a sense of expertise and authority, described by these three words: <strong>Credible</strong>, <strong>Authoritative</strong>, and <strong>Functional</strong>.</p>

      <p class="large-text no-margin-top"><strong>Wireframes</strong></p>
      <p>We developed early wireframes with different options of information hierarchy, displaying the <strong>most crucial information first</strong> for quick assessment. We also explored on dividing the information into two panels to optimize the space.</p>

      <p class="large-text no-margin-top"><strong>Visual Design</strong></p>
      <p>The old <strong>global navigation</strong> had a clunky look and feel, and some of the icons weren't accurate representations of the items. I explored the possibilities of the icons to convey the true meaning, while ensuring the style consistency. Some improvements were also made in the visual hierarchy.</p>

    <div class="middle-column">
      <p>On the subject of <strong>page design</strong>, we moved the sidebar (anchor menus) from the left to the right and minimized its size to <strong>maximize space</strong> for the actual profile information. We divided the profile information into <strong>two panels</strong>: the left panel showed the profile overview, providing a quick way for the user to confirm if it's the profile they're looking for, while the right panel displayed all the details the user needed to make informed decisions. Several options were created and iterated to achieve what we had in mind in the design direction.</p>

      <p class="large-text no-margin-top"><strong>Design System</strong></p>
      <p>Following the design system framework established by other Dow Jones products, I initiated the design system work by building the <strong>foundations</strong>, such as colors, typography, elevation, grids, iconography, etc. Based on the color audit that I did previously, I created the <strong>core palettes</strong> for this product (primary, secondary, tertiary, and so on), and assigned them to the <strong>contextual colors</strong> (ink, interface, and interactive). Once the foundations were defined, it was time to build the <strong>component library</strong>. It's important to keep accessibility in mind throughout this process.</p>

      <p class="large-text no-margin-top"><strong>Implementation and Release</strong></p>
      <p>I conducted <strong>QA</strong> after the components were built in Storybook and <strong>UAT</strong> after the implementation in each environment to ensure alignment between design and development. Rigorous testing was performed by all teams prior to release. We identified several issues in some edge cases, for which we had to <strong>prioritize fixes</strong> based on impact and effort required. We decided to defer some of the fixes to post-release.</p>
      <p>In the end, this project was a big success and was well-received by both users and stakeholders. Users said that the new risk profile page allowed them to find crucial information <strong>faster</strong> and <strong>easier</strong> than before, making their work more efficient. They also complimented the new look and feel, describing it as <strong>clean</strong> and <strong>modern</strong>.</p>

      <h2>Learnings üí´</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="middle-column">
      <p>This project provided valuable insights and lessons, but one of the most significant takeaways for me was the importance of <strong>effective design systems</strong> in a <strong>multi-brand company</strong>. Working within a multi-brand environment presented unique challenges. Each brand or product often requires distinct styling, but our shared component library in code has limited flexibility for assigning tokens. This means that customizations require modifications to the codebase, which can add extra work and time for developers. This experience highlighted the importance of careful planning and coordination when implementing design systems across multiple brands, ensuring that design decisions align with technical <strong>feasibility</strong> and <strong>scalability</strong>.</p>
